# HackNA Website
Website for HackNA

### Please read before making any changes to the HackNA website

##### DO NOT MAKE ANY EDITS TO ARCHIVED VERSIONS OF THE WEBSITE:
* 2017
* minihacks -> 2018workshops.html


##### Creating a website for a new year
* create a base folder for the year you want (e.g. if you're creating a website for HackNA on Jan. 1, 2020, then the folder should be named 2020)
* feel free to do whatever you want in the "2020" folder
* when you're done, contact @akshathjain so I can make sure the https://hackna.org website redirects to your new site

##### Once the HackNA date has passed
* add a link to the website archive in the future/index.html file (on the navbar)
* contact @akshathjain and tell me so the https://hackna.org site redirects to the future branch

##### Creating a MiniHacks landing page
* this is very simple -> just create a shareable Google Doc that has a link viewable to everyone (refer to the 2018 as a template)
* make a copy of 2018workshops.html
* rename this copy to YYYYworkshops.html (e.g. 2020workshops.html)
* make sure YYYYworkshops.html (your new MiniHacks landing page) is in the minihacks folder
* your landing page will be accessible ONLY through the future page
* when you're done, contact @akshathjain so I can make sure everything is accessible

#### Making any changes
* anything committed to the master branch will be live
* be sure you want it to be live before committing to master
* any unfinished changes should be committed to an uncompleted-branch (feel free to make a new one), and when you're ready, merge that branch with the master branch
